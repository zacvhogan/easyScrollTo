# easyScrollTo
A small plug-in JS script for nav bars and buttons, allowing links to smooth scroll to sections on single page sites.

<h2>Basic Use</h2>
easyScrollTo.js matches buttons or anchor elements with similarly named sections.
<br>
<br>
This script requires the following class and ids to be implemented:
<ul>
  <li>Buttons or anchor elements used for navigating the single page site must share the same class;</li>
  <li>These buttons/a elements must each have a unique id in the following format - "button-[sectionName]"</li>
  <li>Each of the page is contained within an element with a unique id formatted - "section-[sectionName]"</li>
</ul>
<br>
Once buttons/anchor elements and page sections have been marked up as described above, clicking on a button/a element will smooth-scroll the viewport to the corresponding section.

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
